<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>You've been hired as an intern for a software development company. As part of your tasks, you need to clean up the code written by your predecessor. Your task consists of renaming all variables in a Java program according to Java naming conventions. The program is simple, it receives a number and returns whether it's an even or odd number. To simplify, you can assume that the program has only one variable that needs renaming.

You have been given the name of the variable, and your task is to return the proper name for that variable. If it's a single-word variable, you should make it all lowercase, and for multi-word variables, they should be written in camelCase.

INPUT:
A single line containing the name of the variable to be renamed. The name only consists of alphabetical characters and may contain any number of spaces (1-100) between words (

OUTPUT:
Print the renamed variable per the Java naming convention. Note: The input will not contain special characters, only alphabetical characters and spaces.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">My variable</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">myVariable</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">number</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">number</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
